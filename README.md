# Morse-code-decoder
The application implements a visual decoding of Morse code using a binary tree.
When writing this application, I was inspired by the popular science book by American programmer Charles Petzold, 
which explains how personal computers work at the hardware and software level.
In the book, the author describes that codes (dashes and dots) can be grouped in such a way 
that their placement depends on the number of dots and dashes in a particular letter.
This way you can build a binary tree.
